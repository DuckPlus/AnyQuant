<p>
From fall through the spring (or vernal equinox), most of the major
secular and sacred holidays are celebrated.  Many of the sacred
holidays in our American "Judeo-Christian" heritage have secular
associations, as many of the seemingly secular holidays actually have
religious roots.
<p>
One example of the mixture of sacred and secular was that
historically in ancient Rome the death and resurrection of Attis, the
god of vegetation, was celebrated on March 24 and 25, corresponding
to the vernal equinox.  Sir James Frazer in _The Golden Bough_ points
out an interesting coincidence.  Among certain Christians in places
where the worship of Attis was known, the death of Jesus Christ was
also celebrated on March 25, though there was little historical
evidence supporting that date.  A controversy is said to have raged
between the pagan and Christian advocates, each claiming that they
had prior claim.
<p>
Many Americans, even religious ones, are unaware of the history
behind the holidays.  If you are interested in <A

of it, you'll like this series on the history of the holidays.  If
you have ever wondered what the historical events are behind <A
