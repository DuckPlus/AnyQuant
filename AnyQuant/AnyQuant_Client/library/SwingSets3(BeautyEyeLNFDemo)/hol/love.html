Love

<pre>
         is patient            and kind    
       is not jealous        does not brag  
     is not arrogant nor   acts unbecomingly
    does not seek its own is not provoked nor 
   does it take into account  a wrong suffered 
   does not rejoice in evil but rejoices in the 
   truth;bears all things, believes all things 
     hopes all things endures all things, it
         never fails. Faith hope and love 
              abide. But the greatest 
                    of these is
                      love.
