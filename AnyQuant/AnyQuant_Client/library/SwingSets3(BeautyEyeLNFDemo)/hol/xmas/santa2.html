One of the traditions of Christmas is Santa Claus, a contraction for
Saint Nicholas, who was born in the 3rd century.  He became a bishop
in Greece and gained distinction in the councils of the church,
being especially famed for unexpected gifts, and later associated
with the giving of presents during the season at the end of the year.
Many stories are told of his kindness, such as the one of the poor man
and his three daughters.  To save the daughters from being sold into
prostitution for want of doweries, St. Nicholas dropped a bag full
of gold down the man's chimney.  It landed in one of the stocking the
eldest daughter had hung up to dry.  Now she could be married.The other
two daughters quickly hung up stockings for St. Nicholas to fill with
gold, so that they, too, could soon be married.  By the way, the three
gold globes of the pawn shop are attributed to this story.

He seems to have been adopted by the Netherlands as the patron saint of
children, and there, on St. Nicholas Eve, they leave their wooden shoes,
or sabots, filled with hay for the Saint's white horse.  He is real to
children the world over, under various names as Kris Kringle, La Befana,
Yule Tomten, and Christkindli.

In 1809 Washington Irving, under the pen name Diedrich Knickerbocker,
wrote 'A History of New York', wherein Saint Nicholas, a jolly personage
smoking a Dutch pipe, skimmed over the treetops in a wagon and dropped
presents down the chimneys.  A few years later, in 1822, Clement C.
Moore wrote a poem for his own children which is most often called 'The
Night Before Christmas'.  Its correct title, however, is 'A Visit from St.
Nicholas'.  Many  are unaware that Moore never once uses the term Santa
Claus, although the reindeer are there, a part of the legend undoubtedly
developed in America, probably by Scandinavians in the United States.
At last, in 1863, Thomas Nast, the cartoonist, drew a picture of Santa
Claus pretty much as he is known today.
