In 1822, Dr. Clement C. Moore was a distinguished professor of Greek and
Hebrew at the General Theological Seminary in New York. He had a famous
father who was the Episcopal Bishop who gave the oath of office to the
first president of the United States, George Washington, and comforted
Alexander Hamilton who was dying of a bullet wound received from Aaron Burr.
<p>
Dr. Moore not only had a famous father, he was a well known scholar in his
own right. He had published numerous theological and scholarly articles,
but none as well know as the poem he was going to write. On Christmas Eve,
1822, he was at home and his wife was packing baskets to be given to the
poor people in their town when she realized she was one turkey short. 
<p>
As he husband left the house for the market, there was a light snow that
provided a white blanket over the city streets. Returning from the market,
he met a Dutch caretaker. He was a short stubby man with a red nose and two
perfectly placed dimples. A pipe was clenched between his teeth and the
smoke coming out of it circled around his head.
<p>
As the two met on the New York street, the caretaker explained to Dr. Moore
how they practiced Christmas in Holland. He explained that they had a
sleigh in which there was a statue of the original Bishop Nicholas and that
someone dressed in red and white walked along the sleigh in a parade and
distributed candy to the children who had gathered along the street.
<p>
They parted and Dr. Moore went back home, sat down and within one hour
composed the well known poem "A Visit from St. Nicholas". Many  are unaware
that Moore never once uses the term Santa Claus.
<p>
We are familiar with the poem from the first lines:
		"Twas the night before Christmas
		When all through the house
		Not a creature was stirring
		Not even a mouse..."

Taken from "The Truth about Santa Claus", 1991 G. Michael Cocoris.
