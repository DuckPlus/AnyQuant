Independence Day, or the Fourth of July, is the adoption by the
Continental Congress on July 4, 1776, of the Declaration of
Independence, proclaiming the severance of the allegiance of the
American colonies to Great Britain.  It is the biggest secular holiday
of the United States, observed in all the states, territories and
dependencies.
<p>
Although it is assumed that the Continental Congress unanimously signed
the document on the 4th of July, in fact not all delegates were present
and there were no signers at all.  Here is what really happened.
<p>
The congressional delegate from Virginia, Richard Henry Lee, introduced
in the Continental Congress, on June 7, 1776, a resolution "that...body
declare the United Colonies free and independent States, absolved from
allegiance to or dependence on the Crown or Parliament of Great
Britain..."  On June 10 a committee of five, headed by Thomas Jefferson
(the actual writer), was appointed to prepare a declaration suitable to
the occasion in the event that the Virginia resolution was adopted.
Jefferson's version was revised by Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, and
Jefferson himself before it went to the Congress where they did some
editing of their own.
<p>
Congress approved the resolution July 2; the declaration composed by
Jefferson and amended by his committee was adopted July 4 and was read
in the yard of the State House July 8.  New York did not even vote on
it until July 9.  The signing was even more gradual, and it is somewhat
misleading to speak of the "fifty-six original signers of the
Declaration of Independence."  By August 6, most of those whose names
are on the document had signed, but at least six signatures were
attached later.  One signer, Thomas McKean, did not attach his name
until 1781!  Some of those who signed were not even in Congress when
the Declaration was adopted, and some who voted for it in Congress
never did get around to signing it.  Robert R. Livingston was one of
the committee of five; he helped to frame it; he voted for it; and he
never signed it.
<p>
The first anniversary of the declaration was observed only in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, by the adjournment of Congress, a ceremonial 
dinner, bonfires, and the ringing of bells and fireworks.  In 1788, after the
requisite number of states had adopted the constitution, Philadelphia
celebrated July 4 by elaborate festivities, including a grand
procession.
<p>
Boston, Massachusetts, first observed the day in 1783, and thereafter this
celebration replaced that of the Boston Massacre, March 5.  The custom
spread to other cities and states, where the day was marked by parades,
patriotic oratory, military displays and fireworks.  In present time,
games and athletic contests, picnics, patriotic programs and pageants,
and community fireworks of pyrotechnic expertise are characteristic of
the 4th of July.
