It was 25 years ago today, 
Captain Kirk taught the band to play,
They've been going in and out of style,
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile...

It has been exactly 25 years on September 8 since the Star Trek
television series began.  The original show is called ST-TOS by purist,
or Star Trek Classic as compared to Star Trek: the Pepsi Generation.
Originally done for three years between 1966 and 1969, this two and a
half decade old series has only gained in popularity.  I remember the
previews from the summer of 1966..."a ship the size of a city".
